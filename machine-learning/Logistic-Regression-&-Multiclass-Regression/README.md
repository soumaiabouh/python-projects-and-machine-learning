# Logistic Regression and Multiclass Regression
This subdirectory contains the code for an Introduction to Machine Learning course project completed last Fall. Our team implemented logistic regression on the IMDB database for sentiment analysis and multiclass regression on a 20 newsgroups database for document classification. I primarily worked on the logistic regression model, including data preprocessing, training, and analysis. I also assisted with the analysis of the multiclass regression model. The code is written in Python using scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy libraries. The project helped us gain a deeper understanding of logistic regression and multiclass regression, as well as their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
