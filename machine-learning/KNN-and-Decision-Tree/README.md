# KNN and Decision Tree
This repository contains a machine learning project completed as part of an Introduction to Machine Learning course. 
The project was a collaboration between myself and a teammate, and involved implementing KNN and Decision Tree algorithms. 
We applied these algorithms to two databases and evaluated their performance using Python. 
The two datasets used were a hepatitis dataset and the Diabetic Retinopathy Debrecen dataset, which we also refer to as Messidor features dataset

As part of this project, I contributed to the implementation and analysis of the Decision Tree algorithm. 
I also participated in the implementation and evaluation of the KNN algorithm. 
The project provided valuable experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world problems and interpreting the results.
The repository includes the code, datasets, and a report summarizing the results of the analysis.
