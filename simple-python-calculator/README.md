# Simple Python Calculator
This is a simple GUI calculator written in Python using the Tkinter library. It was created as part of a course taken at Vanier College. The calculator allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface consists of a text box for displaying the current operand and buttons for entering numbers and operators. The calculator uses the eval() function to evaluate the input string and perform the desired calculation.
