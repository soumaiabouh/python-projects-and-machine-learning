# Simple Python Calculator
This is a simple GUI calculator written in Python using the Tkinter library. It was created by Soumaia Bouhouia as part of a class taken at a Vanier College. The calculator allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface consists of a text box for displaying the current operand and buttons for entering numbers and operators. The calculator uses the eval() function to evaluate the input string and perform the desired calculation. This project is open source and can be found on GitHub.
